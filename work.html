        I had the opportunity to assist on a Press Release photoshoot for an artist (pictured above), which was my first professional work with photography.<br> 
        Although I was an assistant, I was given multiple responsibilities including location scouting and most of the creative direction. <br>
        I've also worked with a few friend's clothing brands. Assisting the main photographer and having creative input.<br>
        I plan to continue to assist and work on similar projects as well as developing my own style and working on my own personal work.

        Through working with brands I was asked if I would model for them. Above is some work I've done for CLINTS and a friend's personal work<br> 
        Since only recently starting I'm working to build up my portfolio through friends and people in the industry.<br>
        I'm aiming to get signed by an agency to further improve my skills and get access to more work. <br>
